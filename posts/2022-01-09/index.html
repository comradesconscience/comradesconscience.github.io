    </header><p>The Democratic Party is, unfortunately, best characterized in the present-day, as a party of ineptitude, apathy, and inaction.</p>
<p>Following an attempted coup led by Trump to overturn an election, which jeopardized the lives of Democratic (and Republican) politicians, the party controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, has failed to seek serious legal actions or legislative policies to condemn the attacks and prevent future assaults on its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Instead, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House, introduced Lin Manuel Miranda and the cast of &ldquo;Hamilton&rdquo; to <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/588608-hamilton-creator-lin-manuel-miranda-cast-members-participate-in">perform</a> at a commemorative event marking the one year anniversary of the Capitol riots. This performative gesture bore a troubling resemblance to the stunt pulled during the summer of 2020 when <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52978780">Democrats wore Ghana&rsquo;s kente cloth and took a symbolic knee</a> following the murder of George Floyd. This was a boring attempt at cultural appropriation and wokeness political theater with effectively no material change in people&rsquo;s lives. As one activist put it, followed by a telling Twitter thread:</p>

<p>The Democrats claim to support Black Americans during election cycles but fail to cancel student debt, which is estimated to increase the wealth of Black Americans by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2021/12/14/the-85-billion-student-loan-payment-restart-weighs-on-racial-wealth-gap/?sh=74c983031a9c">40%</a>.</p>
<p>They claim to be the party that acknowledge climate change, yet famously fail to take any meaningful action to reverse the course of ecological destruction. Instead, Democrats from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/22/dianne-feinstein-sunrise-movement-green-new-deal">California</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/20/us/politics/manchin-climate-change-coal.html">West Virginia</a> routinely dismiss calls to action from climate activists. Despite resuming public appearances at climate summits following Trump&rsquo;s 4-year hiatus from such events, Joe Biden continues in the American tradition of faux progressivism: to protect capitalistic interests, Biden simultaneously presents himself as a champion of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/opinion/biden-climate-change.html">environmentalism</a> while remaining strangely obsessed with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-biden-suddenly-loves-frackers-oil-industry-11634336080">fracking</a> and continues allowing sales of large swaths of land for offshore fossil fuel extraction to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-oil-environment-gas-drilling-gulf-mexico-climate-change-1650202">proceed</a>. Surprising no one paying attention, the moderate climate policies the Biden administration and &ldquo;progressives&rdquo; in Congress pushed for were pulled out from the recently passed bipartisan infrastructure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/12/is-biden-serious-about-climate-his-2000-drilling-and-fracking-permits-suggest-not">bill</a> and stuffed into the &ldquo;Build Back Better&rdquo; bill, which has now come to a grinding halt from conservative Democrats like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/19/climate/manchin-climate-build-back-better-bill.html">Joe Manchin</a>, a move which anyone following his <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/10/a-closer-look-at-joe-manchins-ties-to-the-fossil-fuel-industy/">business interests</a> (e.g., receiving the largest campaign contributions from fossil fuel industries out of anyone in Congress and continuing to make millions of dollars from his coal company, Enersystems) should come to expect.</p>
<p>The Democrats are willing to stump against the War in Iraq as a great foreign policy blunder (to put it mildly), but will shift gears to celebrate, fawn over, and admire the infamous war criminal and former Vice President, Dick Cheney. How can anyone trust Democrats who in one breath claim to distance themselves from unnecessary and unethical warfare and then happily bask in the presence of war-mongerers, some of whom, responsible for millions of deaths, they consider to be <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/hillary-clintons-embrace-of-kissinger-is-inexcusable/">friends</a>, and others, who led <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/01/dick-cheney-defends-america-torture-new-book">practices of torture</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/08/remembering-why-americans-loathe-dick-cheney/244306/">started wars under false pretenses for profit</a>, they continue to cherish:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were very honored by [Dick Cheney] being there. He has a right to be on the floor as a former member of the House. I was happy to welcome him back, and to congratulate him on the courage.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>The Democrats are not going to &ldquo;save democracy,&rdquo; or, more accurately, protect people from fascism. They will, instead, in classic 21st century neoliberal fashion, continue <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57589416">raising police budgets</a> while claiming &ldquo;Black Lives Matter,&rdquo; rail against endless wars but continue <a href="https://time.com/6099377/afghanistan-drone-strike-counterterrorism/">killing civilians abroad</a> and sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of weapons to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-state-dept-okays-650-million-potential-air-to-air-missile-deal-saudi-arabia-2021-11-04/">Saudi Arabia</a>, weapons we know are being used to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3025289/shocking-saudi-coalition-air-strike-kills-more-100-yemen?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article">kill humans in Yemen</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the Democratic Party is yet another capitalist party hellbent on maintaining the systems that enable them to make <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/12/house-speaker-paul-stocks-insider-trading-wealth">endless profits</a>, even if it comes at the cost of millions suffering and hundreds of thousands dying during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>If there is to be a systemic upheaval, it will not be possible through the Democratic Party. It&rsquo;s time we adjust our expectations and not delude ourselves into believing that the Democratic Party is either able or interested in preventing far-right extremism, rampant conspiratorial thinking, or undoing the centuries-old capitalistic traditions of pursuing profits above all else.</p>
