    </header><p>I spent the day yesterday unsure about how to think about the attempted coup on the American government that took place one year ago and, with one year since its happening, have decided to focus on the following (somewhat related) themes for a series of five posts, the first of which follows below: (1) the hollow theater of national security; (2) Trump and his actions won&rsquo;t be effectively chastised by Democrats; (3) incompetence saves us again; (4) Constitutional path allows for a blatant path to subverting electors' votes; and (5) motives, GOP apologists and white bodies.</p>
<p>America works hard by spending billions of dollars annually to give off the impression that it takes its national security seriously. More than anything, as we know well, this is usually used as a guise under which an overriding suspicion of &ldquo;others&rdquo; is harvested by demagogues and profited by the prison and military industrial complexes, without evidencing effective reductions in perceived or actual threats or harm caused to others.</p>
<p>To be specific, following the 9/11 attacks, airport security infamously began to perform <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/01/tsa-business-security-theater-not-security/357599/">&ldquo;Security Theater&rdquo;</a> (removing shoes, disposing bottles of liquids, walking through scanners and being pat down) to create a sense of security via public optics, even though undercover tests of airport security reveal its clear ineffectiveness. For example, a 2017 undercover test <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tsa-fails-half-time-706568">revealed</a> that the TSA failed to catch over 70% of weapons (e.g., mock knives, guns, etc.) that were smuggled through security, an improvement from 2015 when 95% were missed in a similar test.</p>
<p>Similarly, while the federal government continues to increase funding for <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/the-cost-of-immigration-enforcement-and-border-security">&ldquo;border security&rdquo;</a>, the number of &ldquo;migrant encounters&rdquo; at the U.S.-Mexico border <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/09/whats-happening-at-the-u-s-mexico-border-in-7-charts/ft_21-11-01_mexicoborder_1a/">peaked in 2021</a>, suggesting whatever tactics employed by the Department of Homeland Security are ineffective; however, they too are meant to convince American voters that there is an ongoing crisis that is being &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; dealt with. While Trump&rsquo;s immigration policies were openly hostile, racist, and inhumane, Biden&rsquo;s are no better. Reports suggest that the number of detained migrant children has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/08/us/joe-biden-news">increased</a> under the current administration. Kamala Harris told migrants <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57387350">&ldquo;Do not come&rdquo;</a>, even though domestic and international law <a href="http://hrlr.law.columbia.edu/hrlr/enter-at-your-own-risk-criminalizing-asylum-seekers/">prohibits</a> denying asylum seekers without due process.</p>
<p>On a domestic note, the Philadelphia police department received <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-police-tasers-funding-jim-kenney-2021-budget/">$727 million</a> but the department fails to solve <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philly-da-larry-krasner-gun-violence-second-term-inauguration/">83% of shootings</a> and there is reason to believe that this number is higher in reality given instances of incorrect and (not surprisingly) unethical <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-police-robert-redanauer-internal-affairs-lawsuits-arrest-20210506.html">policing practices in the department</a>.</p>
<p>The TSA, CBP/ICE, and militarized cops do not make the country safer. But America remains obsessed with the idea of &ldquo;defense,&rdquo; a misnomer psychologically employed to portray Americans as victims of domestic and international threats of offensive where none or few exist. This tactic of manufacturing and leveraging irrational fears has worked: Americans are worried about being the personal victim of <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/187688/americans-worried-terrorism-mass-shootings.aspx?g_source=Politics&amp;g_medium=newsfeed&amp;g_campaign=tiles">terrorism</a> even though the risk is greatly exaggerated and belittles humans living in countries where risk of terrorism, including from imperialist American hegemony, poses a far greater threat to a person&rsquo;s sense of security.</p>
<p>Although most of this likely won&rsquo;t come as a surprise, it raises an implicit question made recently on Twitter:</p>
<p>{{ &lt; tweet 1479134163655483392 &gt;}}</p>
<p>So, if the U.S. can&rsquo;t manage to &ldquo;defend&rdquo; itself, its electoral proceedings, federal buildings, and politicians with a nearly one-trillion-dollar annual budget from a few hundred far-right insurgents, what is it able to protect? Its hegemonic rule over its people and the world&rsquo;s through a marketable yet artificial creation (and subsequent management) of perceived threats.</p>
